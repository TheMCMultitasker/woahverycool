  Gonna start off with something I wanted to say but didnt really know how or explain well at all yesterday. 

</p>
<br>
<p>Do you like compliments?</p>
<p>
  I love complimenting you, and (as odd as this sounds) I feel like I'm doing it to the point where it gets annoying. Also believe me, I know how damn difficult it is to respond to them, so there's that awkwardness as well. So please just tell me if I'm like, getting too clingy ðŸ’€</p>
    
<br>
<p>
  That's all for today, we're starting off small(ish) for now. I don't know if it exists by the time I've sent you this, but I'm adding an archive/history thingy in case either of us want to look back on these (which hopefully, we won't).</p>
<br>
<p>Bye, love you! <33</p>
