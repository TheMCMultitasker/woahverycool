  Hello!
</p>
<p>
  Hope you had a good day out (although by the time you're seeing this, I've probably already asked you).
</p>
<p>
  I don't have much to say today, it was possibly one of the most boring days ever. I can't even remember what I did for half of it.
  
</p>
<p>
  But that's okay, because nothing bad happened. Apart from me being a small bit sick. But we ball!
</p>
<p>
  I guess I'll just end off with a little reminder so I can drill it into your SmallBrain‚Ñ¢:
</p>
<p>
  You look amazing. All the time. Your skin is great (the many cum moisturizers seem to be working) and your hair literally makes me kick and scream and giggle.

</p>
<p>
  I love you so much. I literally love you more than anything. I literally start grinning without realising whenever we text. You make every day not only bearable, but something to look forward to. You're one of the kindest, funniest, stupidest people I've ever met, and I'm so so so happy that we're friends and now we're (finally) together. You make me so incredibly happy, and all I really ever want to do is give some of that back to you in any way I can.
</p>
<p>
  I love you so so so so much Luke, hopefully we'll talk later (or earlier, depending when you read this). <br>See you <333

  Gonna start off with something I wanted to say but didnt really know how or explain well at all yesterday. 

</p>
<br>
<p>Do you like compliments?</p>
<p>
  I love complimenting you, and (as odd as this sounds) I feel like I'm doing it to the point where it gets annoying. Also believe me, I know how damn difficult it is to respond to them, so there's that awkwardness as well. So please just tell me if I'm like, getting too clingy üíÄ</p>
    
<br>
<p>
  That's all for today, we're starting off small(ish) for now. I don't know if it exists by the time I've sent you this, but I'm adding an archive/history thingy in case either of us want to look back on these (which hopefully, we won't).</p>
<br>
<p>Bye, love you! <33</p>
