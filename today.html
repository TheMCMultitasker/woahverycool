<p>
  Hello!
</p>
<p>
  Hope you had a good day out (although by the time you're seeing this, I've probably already asked you).
</p>
<p>
  I don't have much to say today, it was possibly one of the most boring days ever. I can't even remember what I did for half of it.
  
</p>
<p>
  But that's okay, because nothing bad happened. Apart from me being a small bit sick. But we ball!
</p>
<p>
  I guess I'll just end off with a little reminder so I can drill it into your SmallBrainâ„¢:
</p>
<p>
  You look amazing. All the time. Your skin is great (the many cum moisturizers seem to be working) and your hair literally makes me kick and scream and giggle.

</p>
<p>
  I love you so much. I literally love you more than anything. I didn't realise this until a while ago but I literally start grinning whenever we text. You make every day not only bearable, but something to look forward to. You're one of the kindest, funniest people I've ever met
</p>
