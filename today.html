<br><br>
Gonna start off with something I wanted to say but didnt really know how or explain well at all yesterday. 
<br>
Do you like compliments?
<br>
I love complimenting you, and (as odd as this sounds) I feel like I'm doing it to the point where it gets annoying. Also believe me, I know how damn difficult it is to respond to them, so there's that awkwardness as well. So please just tell me if I'm like, getting too clingy ðŸ’€
<br><br>
That's all for today, we're starting off small(ish) for now. I don't know if it exists by the time I've sent you this, but I'm adding an archive in case either of us want to look back on these (which hopefully, we won't).
<br><br>
Bye, love you! <33
