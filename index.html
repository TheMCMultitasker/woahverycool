<h1>
  TODAY'S MISSION
</h1>
<p>
basically, gonna write some random thing of varying length in here, maybe a rant, maybe a compliment, who knows
<br><br>
this just means that you don't have to see it or respond to it, but you still have the option to!
<br><br>
probably gonna make it look prettier at some point (the typewriter bit on the next screen looker cooler in my head okay ;-;)
<br><br>
anyway, to the thing!</p>
